# JustSayNoToPep

This page is more just me being annoyed about the existence of some of pep8's styling conventions.

Like snakecase eg unreadable method and function casing, and using 4 spaces instead of 1 tab character.

I plan on adding a dictionary scanner which looks for dictionary words in function names and then uses camel casing in the case of methods and mixed case otherwise.
